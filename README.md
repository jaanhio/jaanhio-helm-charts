# jaanhio-helm-charts

This repo contains all my personal helm charts and are released automatically using `helm/chart-releaser-action@v1.1.0` (find latest available version [here](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser/tree/main)) via `gh-pages` branch.

Reference material used to set this up:

- https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/
- https://helm.sh/docs/howto/chart_releaser_action/

Visit https://jaanhio.me/jaanhio-helm-charts/ for access to charts.
